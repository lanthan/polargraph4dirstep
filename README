From Sandy Noble's great firmware and controller:
http://code.google.com/p/polargraph/
http://polargraph.co.uk/
released under GNU GPL v3

polargraph server code (=firmware) modified to run with the Kritzler-like hardware: stepper drivers (dir and step pins) instead of the Adafruit motor shield. This allows for more powerful steppers, improved precision, an expanded choice of hardware.
Currently running on a testboard Atmega328 with two stepstick drivers and a servo, using unmodified polargraph controller from SVN
